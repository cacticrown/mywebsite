        <div class="blog-title"><h1>Making a website as a game developer</h1></div>
        <p>I have been a game developer since I started programming, and I have never looked into the other branches of programming. Something that I have always wanted to make was a website, but I did not want to learn web-dev and all of those no-programming-required tools weren't what I wanted. So that's why on the 4th of August 2025, I started making this website. In this blog post, I will explain how I made this website, and what tools I used.</p>
<h2>What I knew before starting</h2>
<p>Like I said above, I knew nothing about making websites. All I knew was C#, Lua, and lots of frameworks, mostly gamedev-related stuff. Lua and all the other frameworks were not relevant to making this website. I did make use of C# a lot - in fact, I used it to build a static website generator, which is used to power this website.</p>
<h2>Static website generator</h2>
<p>For those who don't know what a static website generator is: it's a tool that takes a template and some content, and generates a static website. A static website is a website that does not change - it is just a bunch of files that are served to the user. This is different from a dynamic website, which can generate content on the fly. I chose to create a static website generator because GitHub Pages, which is a free website hosting service, only supports static websites. Also, it is a lot easier to make a static website because you don't have to worry about databases and server-side code.</p>
<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>Okay, now that you know what a static website generator is, let me explain how I implemented my own. I used C# to create it and it's not even that complicated. The entire project only has 3 C# source files with 258 lines of code in total. Then there's all the HTML and CSS of course, which is a lot more.</p>
<p>Okay, now we're getting to the interesting part - how does it work?</p>
<p>It starts by scanning the Blog folder for blogs. Blogs are basically just folders with an index.md file in them. &quot;md&quot; is for Markdown files, which is quite a simple markup language that is used to format text. Then it will take a template file, which is an HTML file with a comment in it that tells the generator where to put the content of the blog.</p>

<p><em>Part of Template</em>:<br />

<p>But of course we can't just put Markdown in there, because it's two different languages, so the generator will convert the Markdown to HTML using a library called <a href="https://github.com/xoofx/markdig">Markdig</a>. The converted HTML will then be put in the template file, and it will also copy all the content needed by the blog. And just like that, we have a blog post.</p>
<p><em>Injecting Blog Content into Template</em>

<p>The generator will also put every blog post into the homepage so you can access them all from there. You might have noticed that there's also a Projects section on the homepage, which uses a similar system - but a lot simpler, as it is just a link to the GitHub repository of the project.</p>

<p>That is about it, it really is that simple. If you want to learn more about the generator, you can find it on <a href="https://github.com/cacticrown/cacticrown.github.io">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading my blog post! I hope you learned something new.<br />
Have a nice day!</p>
